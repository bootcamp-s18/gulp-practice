# Gulp Practice Project

Installation instructions:

1. Clone the repo locally.

2. Run 'npm install' to download dependencies.

3. Run 'gulp watch' to automatically update the dist directory as html, css, and sass files change. This should automatically load 'localhost:3000' in your browser; this page
will update automatically as content changes.
